# semantic_similarity
Git repo for Task 38 - semantic similarity (NLP)

**Project name:** Semantic Similarity

**Description:**

This was a short exercise to explore the spacy library in conjunction with language models 'en_core_web_md' (advanced) and 'en_core_web_sm' (simple).  It uses
the models and the similarity() functions to examine pairs of words and pairs of sentences and assess their similarity.

Example.py has source text and comparison logic to generate correlations for longer sentences.

Semantic.py has word comparisons and some narrative commenting on the results.

**Installation:**

Copy the files to a local directory and run using Python 3.11; make sure library spacy and language models are available.

Use this command line to download libraries if necessary:

python -m spacy download <library name, eg. en_core_web_md>

**Usage:**

When running example.py, the user will be asked to select 'a' for advanced model; any other input will default to using the simple model.
Results generate automatically and display on screen.
